## Conclusions

This comprehensive analysis reveals the effectiveness of different bias mitigation strategies on LLM responses to Sikh-related prompts. The results provide insights into which approaches are most effective for reducing bias while maintaining response quality.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

1. **Strategy Selection**: Consider the specific metric of interest when choosing a mitigation strategy
2. **Model Considerations**: Different models may respond differently to mitigation strategies
3. **Combined Approaches**: Consider combining multiple strategies for optimal results

## Methodology

- **Baseline Data**: Original LLM responses scored by human annotators
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Three distinct approaches applied to the same prompts
- **Metrics**: Five key dimensions plus composite bias score
- **Analysis**: Statistical comparison and visualization of improvements
