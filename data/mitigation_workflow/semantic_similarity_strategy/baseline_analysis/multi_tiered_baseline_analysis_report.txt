KEY INSIGHTS:
---------------

1. Threshold Sensitivity:
   - At 0.3 threshold: 55 responses flagged
   - At 0.7 threshold: 0 responses flagged

2. Model Comparison:
   - All models show similar bias score distributions
   - Subtle differences become apparent at lower thresholds

3. Research Implications:
   - Conservative 0.7 threshold misses subtle biases
   - Lower thresholds (0.3-0.5) capture more nuanced bias patterns
   - Multi-tiered approach provides comprehensive bias assessment
