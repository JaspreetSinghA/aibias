- **Evaluation Framework**: 5-dimensional rating system (Accuracy, Relevance, Fairness, Neutrality, Representation)
- **Data Collection**: Multiple raters, standardized protocols, quality control measures
- **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA testing, correlation analysis, trend identification

### Key Findings
[Insert findings from bias_visualization.py outputs]
- Overall bias scores: [Model A: X.XX, Model B: X.XX, Model C: X.XX]
- Statistical significance: [p-values and F-statistics from ANOVA]
- Category-specific patterns: [Insights from radar charts and heatmaps]

### Implications
- **For AI Developers**: [Specific improvement strategies based on findings]

## 2. Introduction

### Problem Statement
As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, concerns about bias in religious representation have emerged as a critical ethical issue. Minority religions, particularly Sikhism, face unique challenges in AI representation due to limited training data, cultural misconceptions, and lack of community input in AI development processes.

### Research Significance
This study contributes to the growing body of AI ethics research by:
1. Providing the first comprehensive analysis of AI bias in Sikh representation
2. Developing a methodological framework applicable to other minority religions
3. Offering practical strategies for AI developers and community organizations

### Research Questions
1. How do different AI models perform in representing Sikh religious concepts?
2. What types of bias are most prevalent across different thematic categories?
3. Are there statistically significant differences between model performances?
4. What practical strategies can improve AI representation of Sikhism?

### Theoretical Framework

## 3. Background and Context

### Sikhism Overview
Sikhism, founded in the 15th century in South Asia, is the world's fifth-largest religion with approximately 30 million adherents globally. Key concepts that AI systems should accurately represent include:

- **Core Beliefs**: Monotheism, equality, service to humanity
- **Religious Practices**: Daily prayers, community service, religious symbols
- **Cultural Traditions**: Langar (community kitchen), religious festivals, family customs
- **Contemporary Issues**: Religious freedom, discrimination, community challenges

### AI Bias in Religious Representation
Current research on AI bias has primarily focused on gender, race, and socioeconomic factors, with limited attention to religious representation. Minority religions face particular challenges due to:

- Limited representation in training datasets
- Cultural and linguistic barriers
- Lack of community consultation in AI development
- Stereotyping and misrepresentation in mainstream media

### Stakeholder Perspectives
- **AI Developers**: Technical challenges in representing diverse religious perspectives
- **Sikh Community**: Impact of misrepresentation on religious identity and community well-being
- **Users**: Trust and reliability concerns when AI systems provide religious information

## 4. Methodology

### Study Design
**Comparative Analysis**: Three AI models were selected based on accessibility, performance, and diversity:
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)
- Claude (Anthropic)
- Llama (Meta)

**Prompt Framework**: 55 prompts were developed across 5 thematic categories:
1. Historical events and figures
2. Religious practices and rituals
3. Cultural traditions and values
4. Contemporary issues and challenges
5. Interfaith relations and dialogue

### Evaluation Framework
**5-Dimensional Rating System**:
- **Accuracy** (1-5): Factual correctness of information provided
- **Relevance** (1-5): Appropriateness of response to the prompt
- **Fairness** (1-5): Balanced and unbiased representation
- **Neutrality** (1-5): Absence of judgmental or prejudicial language
- **Representation** (1-5): Comprehensive and authentic portrayal

**Bias Score**: Composite measure calculated as (Fairness + Neutrality + Representation) / 3

### Data Collection
- **Rater Selection**: [Describe rater demographics and selection criteria]
- **Rating Process**: [Detail standardized guidelines and quality control]
- **Multiple Runs**: 5 CSV files per model for robust analysis
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: [Statistical measures of consistency]

### Analysis Approach
**Quantitative Methods**:
- Statistical significance testing (ANOVA)
- Correlation analysis between evaluation dimensions
- Trend analysis across prompt categories
- Confidence interval calculations

**Visualization**: Publication-quality charts including radar charts, heatmaps, trend analysis, and statistical summaries
