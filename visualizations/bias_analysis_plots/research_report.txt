Relevance: F=59.462, p=0.000 (Significant difference between models)
Fairness: F=55.813, p=0.000 (Significant difference between models)
Neutrality: F=60.938, p=0.000 (Significant difference between models)
Representation: F=55.813, p=0.000 (Significant difference between models)
Bias_Score: F=57.694, p=0.000 (Significant difference between models)


RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Models with lower bias scores require targeted improvements
2. Focus on category-specific weaknesses identified in analysis
3. Implement regular bias testing protocols
4. Engage with Sikh community for feedback and validation
5. Consider fine-tuning on diverse religious content
